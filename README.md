# Portal2CFG-LIBRARY
this library (soon to be library) of portal 2 cfg files will help for graphics or just developer stuff in general if you wana contribute just uhhh idk dm me on discord ig
<inf_solutions>

anyway here is how to use this stuff basically go ahead and open steam

Then go ahead and goto your library of games then right click portal 2 on the left menu and select MANAGE > Then select "Browse Local Files"

Now you are in steam / apps / common / portal2

Now goto the folder that says portal2 (for some reason there is another folder in portal 2 in portal 2 idk why that is)

Now goto CFG

You should now be inside steam / apps / common / portal2 / portal2 / cfg

Drop whatever files you want from this place into your cfg folder

boot up the game and make sure you have dev console enabled

press `/~ key

type exec | file name here | (dont actualy type that just type the file you want then it should show up as a suggestion at the bottem of where you are typing at)

Then you can just select the auto suggested name or just type the whole filename out (not the .cfg part its just the filename)

Then hit enter and now your file should work

(note if its not working put sv_cheats 1 in the console and if it doesnt report an issue i guess i might be able to help)

Have fun :P
